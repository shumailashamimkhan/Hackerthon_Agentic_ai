# Quickstart Guide: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Overview
This guide helps you get started with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational content. The book is structured as a Docusaurus-based documentation site covering 5 modules from ROS 2 fundamentals to capstone humanoid projects.

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Getting Started

### 1. Access the Book
- Navigate to the deployed documentation site
- Start with the Introduction module if you're new to Physical AI
- Use the sidebar to navigate between modules

### 2. Learning Path
The book is structured into 5 progressive modules:
1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Learn the fundamentals of robot communication
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Explore simulation environments
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: Understand perception and navigation
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Integrate multimodal AI capabilities
5. **Capstone Project**: Apply all concepts in a comprehensive project

### 3. Interactive Elements
- Follow along with code examples
- Run simulations using the provided environments
- Complete exercises to reinforce learning
- Use the search function to find specific topics

### 4. Simulation Integration
Each module includes links to relevant simulation environments:
- ROS 2 tutorials use standard ROS 2 distributions
- Gazebo environments for physics simulation
- Isaac Sim for advanced perception tasks
- Unity scenes for visualization

### 5. Capstone Project
The final module integrates all concepts in an autonomous humanoid robot project that you can deploy in simulation or on real hardware (Jetson, Unitree, etc.).

## Technical Setup (Optional)
If you want to recreate the simulation environments locally:

1. Install ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill recommended)
2. Set up Gazebo Garden for physics simulation
3. Configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for perception tasks (requires NVIDIA developer account)
4. Install Unity (Personal Edition) for visualization
5. Set up development environment for your target hardware (Jetson, etc.)
