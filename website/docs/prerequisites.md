- **Entrepreneurs**: Looking to develop new applications in robotics and AI

## Prerequisites

To fully benefit from this book, you should have the following background knowledge:

### Essential Prerequisites

#### Programming Skills
- **Proficiency in Python**: Most examples will use Python for AI components
- **Basic knowledge of C++**: Useful for performance-critical robotics components
- **Understanding of object-oriented programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Familiarity with version control**: Particularly Git for collaborative development

#### Mathematics
- **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, transformations (essential for robotics)
- **Calculus**: Derivatives and integrals (for understanding motion and optimization)
- **Probability and Statistics**: For dealing with uncertainty in sensing and decision-making
- **Basic Optimization**: Understanding of optimization concepts

#### Core Technical Concepts
- **Basic Machine Learning**: Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning concepts
- **Fundamental Robotics**: Kinematics, dynamics, control systems
- **Operating Systems**: Understanding of processes, threads, and basic system architecture
- **Linux Command Line**: Comfortable with terminal operations (most development environments are Linux-based)

### Helpful Prerequisites (Not Required)

#### Advanced Topics
- **Computer Vision**: Understanding of image processing and visual perception
- **Path Planning and Navigation**: For the mobile robotics aspects
- **Control Theory**: For understanding robot control systems
- **Experience with Simulators**: Such as Gazebo, Unity, or Unreal Engine

#### Tools and Frameworks
- **Robot Operating System (ROS/ROS2)**: Experience will be beneficial but not required
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar
- **Simulation Environments**: Experience with physics engines like Bullet or NVIDIA PhysX

## Self-Assessment

To determine if you meet the prerequisites, consider the following questions:

### Programming Assessment
- Can you implement a basic neural network from scratch in Python?
- Can you debug multi-threaded applications?
- Are you comfortable reading and modifying existing codebases?

### Mathematics Assessment
- Can you perform 3D transformations using matrices?
- Do you understand gradient descent and its applications?
- Can you interpret a probability distribution?

### Robotics Assessment
- Do you understand the difference between forward and inverse kinematics?
- Can you explain the difference between position, velocity, and force control?
- Are you familiar with sensors commonly used in robotics (IMU, LIDAR, cameras)?

## Resources for Prerequisites

If you find gaps in your knowledge, consider these resources:

### Programming
- "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes
- "Effective Python" by Brett Slatkin
- Online courses on object-oriented programming

### Mathematics
- "Mathematics for Machine Learning" by Marc Peter Deisenroth
- Khan Academy's linear algebra and calculus courses
- MIT OpenCourseWare for probability and statistics

### Robotics
- "Modern Robotics" by Kevin Lynch and Frank Park
- "Probabilistic Robotics" by Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, and Dieter Fox
- Online ROS tutorials

## Learning Path Variations

### For Software Engineers
If you have a strong software background but less robotics experience, focus on:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) for system architecture
- Fundamentals of kinematics and dynamics
- Control systems concepts

### For Robotics Engineers
If you have robotics experience but less AI knowledge, focus on:
- Modern AI techniques for perception and decision-making
- Simulation environments and virtual testing
- Integration of learning algorithms with robotic systems

### For AI Researchers
If you have AI expertise but less robotics experience, focus on:
- Physical constraints and real-time requirements
- Multi-modal sensor integration
- Safety and robustness in physical systems

## Getting Started Without All Prerequisites

While the prerequisites represent the ideal background, don't let gaps discourage you. This book is designed to be accessible:

1. **Mathematical concepts** are explained with intuitive examples
2. **Programming examples** include detailed explanations
3. **Robotics concepts** are motivated with clear use cases
4. **Cross-references** point to additional resources within the text

The most important prerequisite is curiosity and a willingness to learn. We will provide foundational knowledge as we progress, but having the prerequisites will make the learning experience more efficient and deeper.
