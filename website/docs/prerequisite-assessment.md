## Foundational Knowledge Check

### Pre-Study Questions

Answer these questions before proceeding to gauge what you know and what you'll learn:

1. **Robot Communication**: Explain the difference between ROS 1 and ROS 2. If you don't know, write "I need to learn this" and note the topic to review after studying Module 1.

2. **Simulation Environments**: What are the advantages and disadvantages of simulation-first development for robotics? How might real-world testing differ from simulation results?

3. **Perception**: How do robots perceive the world differently than humans? What are some common sensors used in robotics and what do they measure?

4. **Embodied AI**: What is embodied AI and how is it different from traditional AI? Why is embodiment important for robotics?

5. **Navigation**: How do robots navigate in unknown environments? What are the key challenges in mobile robot navigation?

6. **Human-Robot Interaction**: What considerations are important for effective human-robot interaction? How might this differ from human-computer interaction?

### Skill Application Challenges

Try these simple exercises to assess your ability to apply concepts:

1. **Mathematical Modeling**: Given a 2D coordinate transformation problem, can you set up the rotation and translation equations? (Try rotating point (3, 4) by 90 degrees around the origin)

2. **Programming Exercise**: Can you write a simple Python script that reads data from a CSV file, performs a basic operation on it (like averaging), and writes the result to another file?

3. **Problem Decomposition**: Think about opening a door. Break this task into sub-tasks and identify what sensory information would be needed for a robot to complete this task.

## Recommended Preparation Path

Based on your assessment scores, follow these recommendations:

### For Lower Scores (Average below 2.5)

#### Programming Foundations
- Complete Python programming tutorials
- Practice object-oriented programming concepts
- Learn Git basics for version control

#### Mathematics Foundations
- Review linear algebra concepts (especially transformations)
- Refresh calculus knowledge
- Study probability and statistics

#### Robotics Fundamentals 
- Learn basic robotics concepts (kinematics, dynamics)
- Understand robot operating systems like ROS/ROS2
- Study basic control theory

### For Moderate Scores (Average 2.5-3.5)

#### Focus Areas
- Strengthen Python skills with scientific libraries
- Review linear algebra, particularly 3D transformations
- Study basic machine learning concepts
- Gain familiarity with simulation environments

### For Higher Scores (Average above 3.5)
- Dive directly into Module 1
- Focus on specific areas where you scored lower
- Consider skipping review sections if already familiar

## Setting Your Learning Goals

### Personalized Goal Setting

Based on your self-assessment, set specific goals for what you want to achieve:

1. **Knowledge Goals**: What concepts do you want to understand?
   - Example: "Understand the principles of embodied AI"
   - Example: "Learn how to implement basic robot navigation"

2. **Skill Goals**: What abilities do you want to develop?
   - Example: "Be able to configure a ROS 2 system"
   - Example: "Implement a SLAM algorithm in simulation"

3. **Application Goals**: How will you apply your learning?
   - Example: "Contribute to an open-source robotics project"
   - Example: "Apply concepts to my research project"

### Progress Tracking

Set up a simple system to track your progress:

- **Weekly Review**: Assess your understanding of that week's concepts
- **Implementation Journal**: Track code examples you've successfully run
- **Concept Connections**: Note how different concepts relate to each other
